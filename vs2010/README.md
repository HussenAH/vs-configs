## 2012 fashion on a 2010 budget! ##

In late 2012 my work finally decided to upgrade from VS2008... to VS2010. I made this theme simply because I really liked how the 2012 dark theme looked. Not all of the colors are exact as there seem to be some colors in 2010 that are not configurable.

## How To Use ##

There are two files in this directory for the dark theme:

- [VS2012-Dark-for-2010-with-RSharp7.vssettings](https://raw.github.com/aarondandy/vs-configs/master/vs2010/VS2012-Dark-for-2010-with-RSharp7.vssettings): Text editor colors
- [2012-Dark-for-2010.vstheme](https://raw.github.com/aarondandy/vs-configs/master/vs2010/2012-Dark-for-2010.vstheme): IDE chrome (window) colors

You import the `.vssettings` file into Visual Studio using the Tools -> Import and Export Settings... menu option. Of course do backup (export) your current settings to be safe before you import mine. This will set the text editor colors.

Using the [Visual Studio Color Theme Editor](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/20cd93a2-c435-4d00-a797-499f16402378) you can import the `.vstheme` file to set the chrome (window) colors for the IDE.
